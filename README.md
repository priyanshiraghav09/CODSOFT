*TO-DO-LIST* 💻🙌  
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. 
This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.
It can be implemented using a console-based interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or sqlite3.
A basic implementation involves storing tasks in a list, providing options to interact with the list through user input.
